= Credentials

One of the key elements in Hazelcast security is the `Credentials` object, which carries all credentials of an endpoint (member or client). Credentials is an interface which extends `Serializable`. You can either implement the three methods in the `Credentials` interface, or you can extend the `AbstractCredentials` class, which is an abstract implementation of `Credentials`.

Hazelcast calls the `Credentials.setEndpoint()` method when an authentication request arrives at the member before authentication takes place. Here are the methods of `Credentials` interface (see its https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/security/Credentials.html[Javadoc]):

[source,java]
----
public interface Credentials extends Serializable {
    String getEndpoint();
    void setEndpoint( String endpoint ) ;
    String getPrincipal() ;
}
----

Here is the snippet from the abstract implementation of `Credentials` (see its https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.11/javadoc/com/hazelcast/security/AbstractCredentials.html[Javadoc]):

[source,java]
----
public abstract class AbstractCredentials implements Credentials, Portable {
    private String endpoint;
    private String principal;
    ...
}
----

`UsernamePasswordCredentials`, a custom implementation of Credentials, is in the Hazelcast `com.hazelcast.security` package. `UsernamePasswordCredentials` is used for default configuration during the authentication process of both members and clients.

[source,java]
----
public class UsernamePasswordCredentials extends AbstractCredentials {
    private byte[] password;
    ...
}
