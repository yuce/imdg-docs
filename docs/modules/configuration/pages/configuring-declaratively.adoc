= Configuring Declaratively
[[configuring-declaratively]]

This is the configuration option where you use an XML or a YAML configuration
file. When you download and unzip `hazelcast-{page-component-version}.zip`,
you see the following files present in the  `/bin` folder, which are
standard configuration files:

* `hazelcast-default.xml`: Default declarative XML configuration file for Hazelcast.
The configuration for the distributed data structures in this XML file should
be fine for most of the Hazelcast users. If not, you can tailor this XML file according
to your needs by adding/removing/modifying properties. Also see the xref:clusters:setting-up-clusters.adoc[Setting Up Clusters chapter] for the network related configurations.
* `hazelcast-default.yaml`: Default YAML configuration file identical to `hazelcast.xml` in content.
* `hazelcast-full-example.xml`: Configuration file which includes all Hazelcast configuration
elements and attributes with their descriptions. It is the "superset" of `hazelcast.xml`.
You can use `hazelcast-full-example.xml` as a reference document to learn about any element
or attribute, or you can change its name to `hazelcast.xml` and start to use it as your
Hazelcast configuration file.
* `hazelcast-full-example.yaml`: YAML configuration file identical to
`hazelcast-full-example.xml` in content.
* `hazelcast-client-full-example.xml`: Complete Hazelcast Java client example configuration
file which includes all configuration elements and attributes with their descriptions. Read
more about Java client configuration xref:clients:java.adoc#configuring-java-client[here].
* `hazelcast-client-full-example.yaml`: YAML configuration file identical to
`hazelcast-client-full-example.xml` in content.
* `hazelcast-client-failover-full-example.xml`: Complete Hazelcast client failover example
configuration file which includes all Hazelcast client failover configuration elements and
attributes with their descriptions. Read about Blue-Green Deployment and Disaster Recovery
xref:clients:java.adoc#blue-green-deployment-and-disaster-recovery[here].
* `hazelcast-client-failover-full-example.yaml`: YAML configuration file identical to
`hazelcast-client-failover-full-example.xml` in content.

A part of the default XML/YAML configurations is shown as an example below.

[[composing-declarative-configuration]]
== Composing Declarative Configuration

You can compose the declarative configuration of your Hazelcast member or Hazelcast client from multiple declarative
configuration snippets. In order to compose a declarative configuration, you can `import` different
declarative configuration files. Composing configuration files is supported both in XML and YAML configurations with the
limitation that only configuration files written in the same language can be composed.

Let's say you want to compose the declarative configuration for Hazelcast out of two XML configurations: `development-group-config.xml` and `development-network-config.xml`. These two configurations are shown below.

`development-group-config.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <group>
        <name>dev</name>
    </group>
</hazelcast>
----

`development-network-config.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <network>
        <port auto-increment="true" port-count="100">5701</port>
        <join>
            <multicast enabled="true">
                <multicast-group>224.2.2.3</multicast-group>
                <multicast-port>54327</multicast-port>
            </multicast>
        </join>
    </network>
</hazelcast>
----

To get your example Hazelcast declarative configuration out of the above two, use the `<import/>` element as shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <import resource="development-group-config.xml"/>
    <import resource="development-network-config.xml"/>
</hazelcast>
----

The above example using the YAML configuration files looks like the following:

`development-group-config.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  group:
    name: dev
----

`development-network-config.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  network:
    port:
      auto-increment: true
      port-count: 100
      port: 5701
    join:
      multicast:
        enabled: true
        multicast-group: 224.2.2.3
        multicast-port: 54327
----

Composing the above two YAML configuration files needs them to be imported as shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  import:
    - development-group-config.yaml
    - development-network-config.yaml
----


This feature also applies to the declarative configuration of Hazelcast client. See the following examples.


`client-group-config.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    <group>
        <name>dev</name>
    </group>
</hazelcast-client>
----

`client-network-config.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    <network>
        <cluster-members>
            <address>127.0.0.1:7000</address>
        </cluster-members>
    </network>
</hazelcast-client>
----

To get a Hazelcast client declarative configuration from the above two examples, use the `<import/>` element as shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    <import resource="client-group-config.xml"/>
    <import resource="client-network-config.xml"/>
</hazelcast>
----

The same client configuration using the YAML language is shown below.


`client-group-config.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-client:
  group:
    name: dev
----

`client-network-config.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-client:
  network:
    cluster-members:
      - 127.0.0.1:7000
----

Composing a Hazelcast client declarative configuration by importing the above two examples is shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast-client:
  import:
    - client-group-config.yaml
    - client-network-config.yaml
----


NOTE: Use `<import/>` element on top level of the XML hierarchy.

NOTE: Use the `import` mapping on top level of the YAML hierarchy.

Resources from the classpath and file system may also be used to compose a declarative configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <import resource="file:///etc/hazelcast/development-group-config.xml"/> <!-- loaded from filesystem -->
    <import resource="classpath:development-network-config.xml"/>  <!-- loaded from classpath -->
</hazelcast>
----

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  import:
    # loaded from filesystem
    - file:///etc/hazelcast/development-group-config.yaml
    # loaded from classpath
    - classpath:development-network-config.yaml
----

Importing resources with variables in their names is also supported. See the following example snippets:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <import resource="${environment}-group-config.xml"/>
    <import resource="${environment}-network-config.xml"/>
</hazelcast>
----

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  import:
    - ${environment}-group-config.yaml
    - ${environment}-network-config.yaml
----

NOTE: See the xref:using-variables.adoc[Using Variables section] to learn how you can set
the configuration elements with variables.

[[configuring-declaratively-yaml]]
== Configuring Declaratively with YAML

You can configure the Hazelcast members and Java clients declaratively with YAML configuration files in
installations of Hazelcast running on Java runtime version 8 or above.

The structure of the YAML configuration follows the structure of the XML configuration.
Therefore, you can rewrite the existing XML
configurations in YAML easily. There are some differences between the XML and YAML languages
that make the two declarative configurations to slightly derive as the the following examples show.

In the YAML declarative configuration, mappings are used in which the name of the mapping node
needs to be unique within its enclosing mapping. See the following example with
configuring two maps in the same configuration file.

In the XML configuration files, we have two `<map>` elements as shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="map1">
        <!-- map1 configuration -->
    </map>
    <map name="map2">
        <!-- map2 configuration -->
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

In the YAML configuration, the map can be configured under a mapping `map` as shown in
the following example.

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
    ...
    map:
        map1:
          # map1 configuration
        map2:
          # map2 configuration
    ...
----

The XML and YAML configurations above define the same maps `map1` and `map2`.
Please note that in the YAML configuration file
there is no `name` node, instead, the name of the map is used as the name of the
mapping for configuring the given map.

There are other configuration entries that have no unique names and are listed in the
same enclosing entry. Examples to this
kind of configurations are listing the member addresses, interfaces in the networking
configurations and defining listeners. The
following example configures listeners to illustrate this.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <listeners>
        <listener>com.hazelcast.examples.MembershipListener</listener>
        <listener>com.hazelcast.examples.MigrationListener</listener>
        <listener>com.hazelcast.examples.PartitionLostListener</listener>
    </listeners>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

In the YAML configuration, the listeners are defined as a sequence.

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  ...
  listeners:
    - com.hazelcast.examples.MembershipListener
    - com.hazelcast.examples.MigrationListener
    - com.hazelcast.examples.PartitionLostListener
  ...
----

Another notable difference between XML and YAML is the lack of the attributes in the
case of YAML. Everything that can be
configured with an attribute in the XML configuration is a scalar node in the YAML
configuration with the same name. See the
following example.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <network>
        <join>
            <multicast enabled="true">
                <multicast-group>1.2.3.4</multicast-group>
                <!-- other multicast configuration options -->
            </multicast>
        </join>
    </network>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

In the identical YAML configuration, the `enabled` attribute of the XML
configuration is a scalar node on the same level with
the other items of the multicast configuration.

[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  ...
  network:
    join:
      multicast:
        enabled: true
        multicast-group: 1.2.3.4
        # other multicast configuration options
  ...
----
