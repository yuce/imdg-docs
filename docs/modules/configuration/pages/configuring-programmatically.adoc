= Configuring Programmatically
[[configuring-programmatically]]

Besides declarative configuration, you can configure your cluster programmatically.
For this you can create a `Config` object, set/change its properties and attributes
and use this `Config` object to create a new Hazelcast member. Following is an example
code which configures some network and Hazelcast Map properties.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/ProgrammaticConfSample.java[tag=pcs]
----

To create a Hazelcast member with the above example configuration, pass the
configuration object as shown below:

```
HazelcastInstance hazelcast = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );
```

NOTE: The `Config` must not be modified after the Hazelcast instance is started.
In other words, all configuration must be completed before creating the `HazelcastInstance`.
Certain additional configuration elements can be added at runtime as described in the
xref:dynamic-data-structure-configuration.adoc[Dynamically Adding Data Structure Configuration on a Cluster section].

You can also create a named Hazelcast member. In this case, you should set `instanceName`
of `Config` object as shown below:

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
config.setInstanceName( "my-instance" );
Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );
----

To retrieve an existing Hazelcast member by its name, use the following:

```
Hazelcast.getHazelcastInstanceByName( "my-instance" );
```

To retrieve all existing Hazelcast members, use the following:

```
Hazelcast.getAllHazelcastInstances();
```

NOTE: Hazelcast performs schema validation through the file `hazelcast-config-{page-component-version}.xsd`
which comes with your Hazelcast libraries. Hazelcast throws a meaningful exception if there
is an error in the declarative or programmatic configuration.

If you want to specify your own configuration file to create `Config`, Hazelcast supports
several ways including filesystem,
classpath, InputStream and URL.

Building `Config` from the XML declarative configuration:

* `Config cfg = new XmlConfigBuilder(xmlFileName).build();`
* `Config cfg = new XmlConfigBuilder(inputStream).build();`
* `Config cfg = new ClasspathXmlConfig(xmlFileName);`
* `Config cfg = new FileSystemXmlConfig(configFilename);`
* `Config cfg = new UrlXmlConfig(url);`
* `Config cfg = new InMemoryXmlConfig(xml);`

Building `Config` from the YAML declarative configuration:

* `Config cfg = new YamlConfigBuilder(yamlFileName).build();`
* `Config cfg = new YamlConfigBuilder(inputStream).build();`
* `Config cfg = new ClasspathYamlConfig(yamlFileName);`
* `Config cfg = new FileSystemYamlConfig(configFilename);`
* `Config cfg = new UrlYamlConfig(url);`
* `Config cfg = new InMemoryYamlConfig(yaml);`
