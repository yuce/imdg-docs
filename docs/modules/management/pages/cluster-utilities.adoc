= Cluster Utilities

This section provides information on programmatic utilities you can use to listen to the cluster events, to change the state of your cluster, to check whether the cluster and/or members are safe before shutting down a member and to define the minimum number of cluster members required for the cluster to remain up and running. It also gives information on the Hazelcast Lite Member.

== Getting Member Events and Member Sets

Hazelcast allows you to register for membership events so that you are notified when members are added or removed. You can also get the set of cluster members.

The following example code does the above: registers for member events, notifies when members are added or removed and gets the set of cluster members.

[source,java]
----
public class ExampleGetMemberEventsAndSets {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        Cluster cluster = hazelcastInstance.getCluster();
        cluster.addMembershipListener( new MembershipListener() {
            public void memberAdded( MembershipEvent membershipEvent ) {
                System.out.println( "MemberAdded " + membershipEvent );
            }

            public void memberRemoved( MembershipEvent membershipEvent ) {
                System.out.println( "MemberRemoved " + membershipEvent );
            }
        } );

        Member localMember  = cluster.getLocalMember();
        System.out.println ( "my inetAddress= " + localMember.getInetAddress() );

        Set setMembers  = cluster.getMembers();
        for ( Member member : setMembers ) {
            System.out.println( "isLocalMember " + member.localMember() );
            System.out.println( "member.inetaddress " + member.getInetAddress() );
            System.out.println( "member.port " + member.getPort() );
        }
    }
}

== Managing Cluster and Member States

Starting with Hazelcast 3.6, Hazelcast introduces cluster and member states in addition to the default `ACTIVE` state. This section explains these states of Hazelcast clusters and members which you can use to allow or restrict the designated cluster/member operations.

=== Cluster States

By changing the state of your cluster, you can allow/restrict several cluster operations or change the behavior of those operations. You can use the methods `changeClusterState()` and `shutdown()` which are in the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/Cluster.html[Cluster interface] to change your cluster's state.

Hazelcast clusters have the following states:

* **`ACTIVE`**: This is the default cluster state. Cluster continues to operate without restrictions.
* **`NO_MIGRATION`**:
** In this state, migrations (partition rebalancing) and backup replications are not allowed. In other words, there are no data movement between Hazelcast members. However, in case of member failures, backup replicas can be still promoted to the primaries to maintain availability and migration listeners can be notified for these promotion migrations. Please note that promoting a backup replica to the primary replica is a local operation and does not transfer partition data between Hazelcast members.
** The cluster accepts new members.
** All other operations are allowed.
** You cannot change the state of a cluster to `NO_MIGRATION` when migration/replication tasks are being performed.
** When you want to add multiple new members to the cluster, you can first change the cluster state to `NO_MIGRATION`, then start the new members. Once all of them join to the cluster, you can change the cluster state back to `ACTIVE`. Then, the cluster rebalances partition replica distribution at once.
* **`FROZEN`**:
** In this state, the partition table is frozen and partition assignments are not performed.
** The cluster does not accept new members.
** If a member leaves, it can join back. Its partition assignments (both primary and backup replicas) remain the same until either it joins back or the cluster state is changed to `ACTIVE`. When it joins back to the cluster, it owns all previous partition assignments as it was. On the other hand, when the cluster state changes to `ACTIVE`, re-partitioning starts and unassigned partition replicas are assigned to the active members.
** All other operations in the cluster, except migration, continue without restrictions.
** You cannot change the state of a cluster to `FROZEN` when migration/replication tasks are being performed.
** You can make use of `FROZEN` state along with the xref:storage:hot-restart-persistence.adoc[Hot Restart Persistence] feature. You can change the cluster state to `FROZEN`, then restart some of your members using the Hot Restart feature. The data on the restarting members will not be accessible but you will be able to access to the data that is stored in other members. Basically, `FROZEN` cluster state allows you do perform maintenance on your members with degrading availability partially.
* **`PASSIVE`**:
** In this state, the partition table is frozen and partition assignments are not performed.
** The cluster does not accept new members.
** If a member leaves while the cluster is in this state, the member will be removed from the partition table if cluster state moves back to `ACTIVE`.
** This state rejects ALL operations immediately EXCEPT the read-only operations like `map.get()` and `cache.get()`, replication and cluster heartbeat tasks.
** You cannot change the state of a cluster to `PASSIVE` when migration/replication tasks are being performed.
** You can make use of `PASSIVE` state along with the xref:storage:hot-restart-persistence.adoc[Hot Restart Persistence] feature. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/Cluster.html#shutdown--[Cluster Shutdown API] for more info.
* **`IN_TRANSITION`**:
** This state shows that the state of the cluster is in transition.
** You cannot set your cluster's state as `IN_TRANSITION` explicitly.
** It is a temporary and intermediate state.
** During this state, your cluster does not accept new members and migration/replication tasks are paused.

NOTE: All in-cluster methods are fail-fast, i.e., when a method fails in the cluster, it throws an exception immediately (it is not retried).

The following snippet is from the `Cluster` interface showing the methods used to manage your cluster's states.

[source,java]
----
public interface Cluster {
    ClusterState getClusterState();
    void changeClusterState(ClusterState newState);
    void changeClusterState(ClusterState newState, TransactionOptions transactionOptions);
    void shutdown();
    void shutdown(TransactionOptions transactionOptions);
----

See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{page-component-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/Cluster.html[Cluster interface Javadoc] for information on these methods.

=== Cluster Member States

Hazelcast cluster members have the following states:

* **`ACTIVE`**: This is the initial member state. The member can execute and process all operations. When the state of the cluster is `ACTIVE` or `FROZEN`, the members are in the `ACTIVE` state.
* **`PASSIVE`**: In this state, member rejects all operations EXCEPT the read-only ones, replication and migration operations, heartbeat operations and the join operations as explained in the <<cluster-states, Cluster States section>> above. A member can go into this state when either of the following happens:
. Until the member's shutdown process is completed after the method `Node.shutdown(boolean)` is called. Note that, when the shutdown process is completed, member's state changes to `SHUT_DOWN`.
. Cluster's state is changed to `PASSIVE` using the method `changeClusterState()`.
* **`SHUT_DOWN`**: A member goes into this state when the member's shutdown process is completed. The member in this state rejects all operations and invocations. A member in this state cannot be restarted.

[[using-the-script-cluster-sh]]
== Using the cluster.sh Script

You can use the script `cluster.sh`, which comes with the Hazelcast package, to
get/change the state of your cluster, to shutdown your cluster and
to force your cluster to clean its persisted data and make a fresh start.
The latter is the Force Start operation of Hazelcast's Hot Restart Persistence feature.
See the xref:storage:hot-restart-persistence.adoc#force-start[Force Start section].

NOTE: The script `cluster.sh` uses `curl` command and `curl` must be installed to be able to use the script.

The script `cluster.sh` takes the following parameters to operate according to your needs.
If these parameters are not provided, the default values are used.

[cols="2,2,5a"]
|===
|Parameter | Default Value | Description

|`-o` or `--operation`
|`get-state`
|Executes a cluster-wide operation. Operations can be the following:

* IMDG Open Source operations: `get-state`, `change-state`, `shutdown` and `get-cluster-version`.
* IMDG Enterprise operations: `force-start`, `partial-start` and `change-cluster-version`.

|`-s` or `--state`
|None
|Updates the state of the cluster to a new state. New state can be `active`,
`no_migration`, `frozen`, `passive`. This is used with the operation `change-state`.
This parameter has no default value; when you use this, you should provide a valid state.

|`-a` or `--address`
|`127.0.0.1`
|Defines the IP address of a cluster member. If you want to manage your cluster remotely,
you should use this parameter to provide the IP address of a member to this script.

|`-p` or `--port`
|`5701`
|Defines on which port Hazelcast is running on the local or remote machine.

|`-c` or `--clustername`
|`dev`
|Defines the name of a cluster which is used for a simple authentication.
See the xref:clusters:creating-clusters.adoc[Creating Clusters section].

|`-P` or `--password`
|`dev-pass`
|Defines the password of a cluster (valid only for Hazelcast releases older than 3.8.2).
See the xref:clusters:creating-clusters.adoc[Creating Clusters section].

|`-v` or `--version`
|_no argument expected_
|Defines the cluster version to change to. It is used in conjunction with
the `change-cluster-version` operation.

|`-d` or `--debug`
|_no argument expected_
|Prints error output.

|`--https`
|_no argument expected_
|Uses HTTPS protocol for REST calls.

|`--cacert`
|_set of well-known CA certificates_

|`--cert`
|None
|Defines PEM-encoded client certificate file path. Only needed when client certificate authentication is used.

|`--key`
|None
|Defines PEM-encoded client private key file path. Only needed when client certificate authentication is used.

|`--insecure`
|_no argument expected_
|Disables member certificate verification.
|===

The script `cluster.sh` is self-documented; you can see the parameter descriptions using
the command `./cluster.sh -h` or `./cluster.sh --help`.

NOTE: You can perform the above operations using the Hot Restart tab of Hazelcast Management Center or
using the REST API. See the xref:management-center:monitor-imdg:cluster-administration.adoc#hot-restart[Hot Restart]
and <<using-rest-api-for-cluster-management, Using REST API for Cluster Management>> sections
in the Hazelcast Management Center documentation.

=== Example Usages for cluster.sh

Let's say you have a cluster running on remote machines and one Hazelcast member is running on the IP `172.16.254.1` and on the port
`5702`. The cluster name and password of the cluster are `test` and `test`.

**Getting the cluster state:**

To get the state of the cluster, use the following command:

`./cluster.sh -o get-state -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

The following also gets the cluster state, using the alternative parameter names, e.g., `--port` instead of `-p`:

`./cluster.sh --operation get-state --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --clustername test --password test`

**Changing the cluster state:**

To change the state of the cluster to `frozen`, use the following command:

`./cluster.sh -o change-state -s frozen -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

Similarly, you can use the following command for the same purpose:

`./cluster.sh --operation change-state --state frozen --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --clustername test --password test`

**Shutting down the cluster:**

To shutdown the cluster, use the following command:

`./cluster.sh -o shutdown -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

Similarly, you can use the following command for the same purpose:


`./cluster.sh --operation shutdown --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --clustername test --password test`

**Partial starting the cluster:**

To partial start the cluster when Hot Restart is enabled, use the following command:

`./cluster.sh -o partial-start -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

Similarly, you can use the following command for the same purpose:

`./cluster.sh --operation partial-start --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --clustername test --password test`

**Force starting the cluster:**

To force start the cluster when Hot Restart is enabled, use the following command:

`./cluster.sh -o force-start -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

Similarly, you can use the following command for the same purpose:

`./cluster.sh --operation force-start --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --clustername test --password test`

**Getting the current cluster version:**

To get the cluster version, use the following command:

`./cluster.sh -o get-cluster-version -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

The following also gets the cluster state, using the alternative parameter names, e.g., `--port` instead of `-p`:

`./cluster.sh --operation get-cluster-version --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --clustername test --password test`

**Changing the cluster version:**

See the xref:rolling-member-upgrades.adoc[Rolling Member Upgrades chapter] to learn more about the cases when you should change the cluster version.

To change the cluster version to `X.Y`, use the following command:

`./cluster.sh -o change-cluster-version -v X.Y -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

The cluster version is always in the `major.minor` format, e.g., 3.12. Using other formats results in a failure.

**Calls against the TLS protected members (using HTTPS protocol):**

When the member has TLS configured, use the `--https` argument to instruct `cluster.sh` to use the proper URL scheme:

[source,sh]
----
./cluster.sh --https \
  --operation get-state --address member1.example.com --port 5701
----

If the default set of trusted certificate authorities is not sufficient, e.g, you use a self-signed certificate,
you can provide a custom file with the root certificates:

[source,sh]
----
./cluster.sh --https \
  --cacert /path/to/ca-certs.pem \
  --operation get-state --address member1.example.com --port 5701
----

When the TLS mutual authentication is enabled, you have to provide the client certificate and related private key:

[source,sh]
----
./cluster.sh --https \
  --key privkey.pem \
  --cert cert.pem \
  --operation get-state --address member1.example.com --port 5701
----

NOTE: Currently, this script is not supported on the Windows platforms.

== Using REST API for Cluster Management

Besides the Management Center's xref:management-center:monitor-imdg:cluster-administration.adoc#hot-restart[Hot Restart tab] and
the script <<using-the-script-cluster-sh, `cluster.sh`>>, you can also use REST API to manage your cluster's state.
The following are the operations you can perform.

NOTE: Some of the REST calls listed below need their REST endpoint groups to be enabled.
See the xref:rest-endpoint-groups.adoc[Using the REST Endpoint Groups section] on how to enable them.

Also note that the value of `$\{PASSWORD}` in the following calls is checked only if
the security is xref:security:enabling-jaas.adoc[enabled] in Hazelcast IMDG, i.e., if you have Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Edition.
If the security is disabled, the `$\{PASSWORD}` can be left empty.

|===
|**IMDG Open Source commands**

* _Checking if a member is ready to be used:_
+
When a member joins the cluster, you can check whether it is ready to be used with the following HTTP call.
It should return the `200` status code, meaning that the member can be safely used.
Otherwise, it returns the `503` status code indicating the member is not available yet.
Only HTTP GET request method is supported.

|===

== Enabling Lite Members

Lite members are the Hazelcast cluster members that do not store data.
These members are used mainly to execute tasks and register listeners and they do not have partitions.

You can form your cluster to include the regular Hazelcast members to store data and
Hazelcast lite members to run heavy computations.
The presence of the lite members do not affect the operations performed on the other members in the cluster.
You can directly submit your tasks to the lite members, register listeners on them and invoke operations for
the Hazelcast data structures on them such as `map.put()` and `map.get()`.

IMPORTANT: If you want to use lite members in a Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise
cluster, they are also subjected to the Enterprise license.

=== Configuring Lite Members

You can enable a cluster member to be a lite member using declarative or programmatic configuration.

**Declarative Configuration:**

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <lite-member enabled="true"/>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  lite-member:
    enabled: true
----
====

**Programmatic Configuration:**

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
config.setLiteMember(true);
----

=== Promoting Lite Members to Data Member

Lite members can be promoted to data members using the `Cluster` interface.
When they are promoted, cluster partitions are rebalanced and ownerships of some portion of
the partitions are assigned to the newly promoted data members.

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
config.setLiteMember(true);

HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
Cluster cluster = hazelcastInstance.getCluster();
cluster.promoteLocalLiteMember();
----

NOTE: A data member cannot be downgraded to a lite member back.

== Defining Member Attributes

You can define various member attributes on your Hazelcast members.
You can use these member attributes to tag your members as may be required by your business logic.

To define a member attribute on a member, you can:

* provide `MemberAttributeConfig` to your `Config` object
* or provide the member attributes at runtime via attribute setter methods on the `Member` interface.

For example, you can tag your members with their CPU characteristics and
you can route CPU intensive tasks to those CPU-rich members. Here is how you can do it:

[source,java]
----
public class ExampleMemberAttributes {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MemberAttributeConfig fourCore = new MemberAttributeConfig();
        memberAttributeConfig.setAttribute( "CPU_CORE_COUNT", "4" );
        MemberAttributeConfig twelveCore = new MemberAttributeConfig();
        memberAttributeConfig.setAttribute( "CPU_CORE_COUNT", "12" );
        MemberAttributeConfig twentyFourCore = new MemberAttributeConfig();
        memberAttributeConfig.setAttribute( "CPU_CORE_COUNT", "24" );

        Config member1Config = new Config();
        config.setMemberAttributeConfig( fourCore );
        Config member2Config = new Config();
        config.setMemberAttributeConfig( twelveCore );
        Config member3Config = new Config();
        config.setMemberAttributeConfig( twentyFourCore );

        HazelcastInstance member1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( member1Config );
        HazelcastInstance member2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( member2Config );
        HazelcastInstance member3 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( member3Config );

        IExecutorService executorService = member1.getExecutorService( "processor" );

        executorService.execute( new CPUIntensiveTask(), new MemberSelector() {
            @Override
            public boolean select(Member member) {
                int coreCount = Integer.parseInt(member.getAttribute( "CPU_CORE_COUNT" ));
                // Task will be executed at either member2 or member3
                if ( coreCount > 8 ) {
                    return true;
                }
                return false;
            }
        } );

        HazelcastInstance member4 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        // We can also set member attributes at runtime.
        member4.setAttribute( "CPU_CORE_COUNT", "2" );
    }
}
----

For another example, you can tag some members with a filter so that
a member in the cluster can load classes from those tagged members.
See the xref:clusters:deploying-code-on-member.adoc[User Code Deployment section] for more information.

You can also define your member attributes through declarative configuration and
start your member afterwards. Here is how you can use the declarative approach:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <member-attributes>
        <attribute name="CPU_CORE_COUNT">4</attribute-name>
    </member-attributes>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  member-attributes:
    CPU_CORE_COUNT:
      type: int
      value: 4
----
====

== Safety Checking Cluster Members

To prevent data loss when shutting down a cluster member, Hazelcast provides
a graceful shutdown feature. You perform this shutdown by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`.

The oldest cluster member migrates all of the replicas owned by
the shutdown-requesting member to the other running (not initiated shutdown) cluster members.
After these migrations are completed, the shutting down member will not be the owner or
a backup of any partition anymore. It means that you can shutdown any number of Hazelcast members
in a cluster concurrently with no data loss.

Please note that the process of shutting down members waits for
a predefined amount of time for the oldest member to migrate their partition replicas.
You can specify this graceful shutdown timeout duration using the property `hazelcast.graceful.shutdown.max.wait`.
Its default value is 10 minutes. If migrations are not completed within this duration,
shutdown may continue non-gracefully and lead to data loss.
Therefore, you should choose your own timeout duration considering the size of data in your cluster.

=== Ensuring Safe State with PartitionService

With the improvements in graceful shutdown procedure in Hazelcast 3.7,
the following methods are not needed to perform graceful shutdown.
Nevertheless, you can use them to check the current safety status of the partitions in your cluster.

[source,java]
----
public interface PartitionService {
   ...
   ...
    boolean isClusterSafe();
    boolean isMemberSafe(Member member);
    boolean isLocalMemberSafe();
    boolean forceLocalMemberToBeSafe(long timeout, TimeUnit unit);
}
----

The method `isClusterSafe` checks whether the cluster is in a safe state.
It returns `true` if there are no active partition migrations and all backups are in sync for each partition.

The method `isMemberSafe` checks whether a specific member is in a safe state.
It checks if all backups of partitions of the given member are in sync with the primary ones.
Once it returns `true`, the given member is safe and it can be shut down without data loss.

Similarly, the method `isLocalMemberSafe` does the same check for the local member.
The method `forceLocalMemberToBeSafe` forces the owned and backup partitions to be synchronized,
making the local member safe.

See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/monitoring/cluster-safety[here^]
for more `PartitionService` code samples.
